## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program
Branching  
Helped me isolate features such as the footer and navigation without affecting the main code. This made testing and bug fixing easier.

Pull Requests  
Pull requests allowed me to review and manage code changes before merging. I used them to track progress and make sure each change was clear and justified.

Issues and Milestones  
I used issues to break down tasks like adding sections and fixing bugs. Milestones helped me group these tasks and stay on schedule.

GitHub Project Board  
The board gave me a clear visual layout of tasks using “To Do”, “In Progress”, and “Done” columns. This helped me stay focused and complete each section step-by-step.



## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features


### A. Milestones and Issues

This screenshot shows the milestone I created (“Final Portfolio Submission”) and the issues linked to it, such as “Add Footer Section”

### B. Project Board

The GitHub Project Board has columns for "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Issues like “Add About Section” and “Fix layout” are organized by status

### C. Branching

Here I show three branches — `about`, `addfooter`, and `navigation` — each representing different features I worked on separately.

### D. Pull Requests

This shows the pull request created from `addfooter` into `main`, with a description and linked changes to the `index.html`.

### E. Merge Conflict Resolution
I attempted to create a merge conflict by editing the same line of `index.html` in both the `main` and `navigation` branches. GitHub detected the conflict when I opened the pull request, but the conflict editor kept loading and did not allow me to complete the resolution.

In a typical case, when a merge conflict occurs:
- GitHub highlights the conflicting lines using `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`
- I would manually edit the conflicting section to keep or combine the changes
- Then I would mark the conflict as resolved and commit the merge

Although I could not complete the resolution in this attempt due to a GitHub issue, I understand how merge conflicts are triggered and resolved.
